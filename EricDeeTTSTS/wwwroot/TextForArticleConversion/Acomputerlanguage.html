                Since the interpreter is written and working properly with exit functions, it's time for a
                more mathematical approach. In this article, I discuss how to determine instruction keywords using decimal values to deduce ASCII character strings.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                I remove all signaled ("") character logic checks, and replace methods with decimal counters. The computer needs to take an input, then it
                has to insert the string into memory. The most crucial part to this is that the writer must replace all visual characters with decimal counterparts.
                In so doing, all letters can be added as numbers. At this stage, a paragraph can be represented as a sum. With this sum, you can subtract user definitions,
                AKA instructions; to get whether a sentence exists, and whether that sentence makes any sense.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                It's really that simple. If you look at the images, you can see that all that is left to do is define your own instructions by declaring key value pair
                dictionaries. For example, 619 = the sentence "To blue". From here, you can do whatever you want. You just need to implement methods to check for character
                ordering for some fringe use cases where properly arranged sentences might add up to the same number. Be sure to stay tuned for more information.

            <h3><u class="Index">Lexer improvements (part 2)</u></h3>
            <p>
                <time class="Dated" datetime="2021-01-13" title="2021-01-13" style="font-size: .66rem; padding: 3px;"><i>January 13, 2021</i></time>
            </p>

            <p>
                I saw someone entered a command ",Get resume.". It caused the lexical analyzer to fail!
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                What did I do to fix it? It took some thinking, especially since this lexer is a pre-dated version. There's just so much to do and I have to be smart
                with my focus; so the fix was this; add emergency exits, and provide the lexer with a "smart" detection system.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                By using decimal values instead of ASCII visual characters, the lexer now just checks if the number is equal to a letter representation, and if it does
                tries to read it. There is a lookahead to take into account, which causes this thing to be a very powerful switch mechanism. It does an awesome job at deducing
                instructions regardless of their order, and terminating; but it doesn't do as well of a job at "being humanized", so if it doesn't find something it knows, it gets
                caught in a forever loop. The fix to that, is to program it to always quit if it ever gets caught, or "confused". Now it's just about 100% reliable.
